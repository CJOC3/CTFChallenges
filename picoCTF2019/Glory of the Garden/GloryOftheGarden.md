### Description 
- This garden contains more than it seems.

### Category 
- Forensics 

### Approach 
- Whenever there are images involved, I make it a habit to first check its file type by running `file` on a certain image.  
- Nothing out of the ordinary, next step is to run `strings` on the image.
- The flag is revealed upon running the previous command. 

### Flag 
- picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y33dd2eEF5}
